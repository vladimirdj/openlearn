*OpenLearn* is an online Learning Management System solution enabling instructors to create their own private website filled with dynamic courses that extend learning anytime, anywhere. It helps the instructors create effective online teaching and learning experiences for the students in a collaborative and private environment, and helps students build their talent pool at their convenience.

It is being developed using the following languages:

(1) HTML,

(2) CSS,

(3) PHP, and

(4) JavaScript (alongwith jQuery at certain places).

And, the database used is MySQL.

It has the following features:

**1. A virtual classroom:** It has a virtual whiteboard which can be used by the instructors to teach the students in real-time. Whatever the instructor would draw or write on that virtual whiteboard are broadcasted to the students pursuing in “real-time”, which would essentially be similar to as if they are studying in a physical classroom. Technically, it would be comprised of an HTML5 Canvas for drawing and the broadcast mechanism would be made available with assistance of technologies such as WebSockets, Node.js, and Socket.io.

Assignment Upload and Download Portal: It can be used by the instructors to upload handouts or documents relevant to the course that can be downloaded by the students any time for reference.

**2. Video Repository:** The instructors can embed the videos from YouTube (with an embed code) under certain course title and can provide a description of the video in each page of the course. The students can browse through the videos any time.

**3. Announcements:** Instructors can use this page for any announcements about the course.

**4. A contact page:** It would be used by the students to contact the instructor of the opted course in case they need to ask them any questions.
