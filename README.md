*OpenLearn* is an online Learning Management System solution enabling instructors to create their own private website filled with dynamic courses that extend learning anytime, anywhere. It helps the instructors create effective online teaching and learning experiences for the students in a collaborative and private environment, and helps students build their talent pool at their convenience.

It is being developed using the following languages:

   (1) HTML,

   (2) CSS,

   (3) PHP, and

1. It is an open learning platform in which any instructor can sign up for free, and teach their students.

2. No signup required for students. Anyone can learn any time, anywhere.

3. A contact page, where any student can contact any teacher in case he/she has any questions related to the course.
